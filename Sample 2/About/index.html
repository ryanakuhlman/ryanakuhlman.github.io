		<p>Hello, my name is John Smith. I have always loved photography, ever since I got my first camera when I was 10. At that age, I have been know for making short films and photos. People said that I was going to be a future director, but I decided to keep my career simple and do photography freelancing. </p>

		<p>I live in New York, but it doesn't seem like it since I travel so othen. My favorite places to take pictures is in the mountains in Canada and northern Europe. I love mountains, I grew up in Colorado and every summer, my family and I would travel to the cabin in Montana and spend a month there. There, the mountains were spectacular. That was where I developed my love for mountains. </p>

		<p>There is nothing in me that tells me that photography isn't for me. I love my job, I always put 100% effort in every photo I take. What makes my job even better is when the clients are impressed with the photos. I also love taking on new challenges, things that I haven't experienced yet. That is how I learn and expand on my talents, doing new things. Whatever type of photos you want me to do, I am not afraid of tring, believe me, I had to take pictures of tigers before. Well if you are interested in my work, contact me. There is so much we could do.</p>
